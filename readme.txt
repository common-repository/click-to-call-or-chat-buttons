A flexible module which adds two buttons that can be called directly by phone or WhatsApp.

This plugin adds two full configurable  buttons on the website that allows direct dialing via mobile phone or WhatsApp with a simple click.

The buttons are fully configurable and offer the possibility to add a custom text.
You can change the colors, text size, edges and position of the buttons.



**How to configure?**

Fill in the phone numbers "Phone number to call" and "WhatsApp number to call" and the texts associated with them "Phone number (or text) to display” or “WhatsApp number (or text) to display"
The associated texts will only appear in the box if you fill them in with their icons.
It is recommended for phone numbers to contain the country code (prefix) and to be in a callable format (for example "+41987654321"). However, the associated texts can contain any text or any format of telephone numbers (for example “Call Us” or “0987.654.321”)

**Choose the colors**

If you do not want a specific color and prefere the element to be transparent, then delete the color from the corresponding field.

**Set the positioning**

In the "Topography" group set the active fields, display mode and position.

Also in "Restrict appearance" set on which pages the buttons will appear. If you select "Only on pages" or "Not on pages" then fill in the ID of the pages or posts separated by commas.

**Set events tracking**

If the Google Analytics tracking code is already added to the page, then choose the appropriate version to track events.
The module will automatically add the tracking script and you will be able to find the events in Google Analytics by clicking Behavior> Events> Overview

**Save changes**

After checking the completed fields, save the changes and retouch the appearance if necessary.

**Finally**

Finally, test if buttons call the right numbers and verify the Google Analytics events traking.
